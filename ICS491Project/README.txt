Kristopher Nakamura: Program functionalities (PaystubLogin.java, PaystubRetriever.java, TimeCardLogin.java, README)
Vinson Gao: Program GUI(clockin.java, clockout.java, ColorTable.java, login.java, logs.java)


Current Progress

We had to pretty much redo our whole program due to issues with misunderstandings across all three members. 
To solve the problem, we drafted out a rough flow chart of the functionalities as well as drew out how the GUI should look. 
Now, everything is pretty much ready to go but in fragments, the program simply needs the GUI combined together with the 
functionality. We're planning on trying to create a remote database to access for our next iteration as well as having a 
fully running program.
