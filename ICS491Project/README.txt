Current Progress/Final Thoughts

The program runs with slight issues. There are small typos and lack of features such as certain warning messages but the 
largest issue the program has is that the calculations for the total hours worked and wages earned is not working at the 
moment. The program still properly keeps track of the clock in and out time regardless of that issue. There was still a lack 
of communication between the programmers due to work and time mismatches, and if that was done better, we could have had a 
much more robust program. The comments in the code helped to reduce time of understanding other's code.






Version 2 submission

Contributors:

Weng Lam Sio: Program database, vulnerabilities testing (PaystubLoginTest.java, pictures of database on git under the package 'clockinsystem' [since we're running on a local database])
Kristopher Nakamura: Program functionalities (PaystubLogin.java, PaystubRetriever.java, TimeCardLogin.java, README)
Vinson Gao: Program GUI(clockin.java, clockout.java, ColorTable.java, login.java, logs.java)


Current Progress

We had to pretty much redo our whole program due to issues with misunderstandings across all three members. To solve the 
problem, we drafted out a rough flow chart of the functionalities as well as drew out how the GUI should look. 
Now, everything is pretty much ready to go but in fragments, the program simply needs the GUI combined together with the 
functionality. We're planning on trying to create a remote database to access for our next iteration as well as having a 
fully running program.

Currently Completed

At the moment, our code doesn't have much functionality. A very simple GUI was set up as a placeholder for the program.


Functionality
Details:

    None except for the GUI opening


GUI
Details:

    A mock GUI of what the interface may look like
