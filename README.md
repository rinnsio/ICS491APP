  <li>Weng Lam Sio: Program database, vulnerabilities testing (PaystubLoginTest.java, pictures of database on git [since we're running on a local database])</li>
  <li>Kristopher Nakamura: Program functionalities (PaystubLogin.java, PaystubRetriever.java, TimeCardLogin.java, README)</li>
  <li>Vinson Gao: Program GUI(clockin.java, clockout.java, ColorTable.java, login.java, logs.java)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Current Progress</h3>
  <p>
    We had to pretty much redo our whole program due to issues with misunderstandings across all three members.  To solve the problem, we drafted out a rough flow chart of the functionalities as well as drew out how the GUI should look.  Now, everything is pretty much ready to go but in fragments, the program simply needs the GUI combined together with the functionality.  We're planning on trying to create a remote database to access for our next iteration as well as having a fully running program.

<h2>Currently Completed</h2>
At the moment, our code doesn't have much functionality.  A very simple GUI was set up as a placeholder for the program.

<h3>Functionality</h3>
Details:
 <ul>
  <li>None except for the GUI opening</li>
 </ul>
 
<h3>GUI</h3>
Details:
  <ul>
    <li>A mock GUI of what the interface may look like</li>
  </ul>
