<h3>Current Progress/Final Thoughts</h3>
  <p>
    The program runs with slight issues.  There are small typos and lack of features such as certain warning messages but the largest issue the program has is that the calculations for the total hours worked and wages earned is not working at the moment.  The program still properly keeps track of the clock in and out time regardless of that issue.  There was still a lack of communication between the programmers due to work and time mismatches, and if that was done better, we could have had a much more robust program.  The comments in the code helped to reduce time of understanding other's code.

<h1>Version 2 submission</h1>
<h2>Contributors:</h2> 
<ul>
  <li>Weng Lam Sio: Program database, vulnerabilities testing (PaystubLoginTest.java, pictures of database on git under the package 'clockinsystem' [since we're running on a local database])</li>
  <li>Kristopher Nakamura: Program functionalities (PaystubLogin.java, PaystubRetriever.java, TimeCardLogin.java, README)</li>
  <li>Vinson Gao: Program GUI(clockin.java, clockout.java, ColorTable.java, login.java, logs.java)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Current Progress</h3>
  <p>
    We had to pretty much redo our whole program due to issues with misunderstandings across all three members.  To solve the problem, we drafted out a rough flow chart of the functionalities as well as drew out how the GUI should look.  Now, everything is pretty much ready to go but in fragments, the program simply needs the GUI combined together with the functionality.  We're planning on trying to create a remote database to access for our next iteration as well as having a fully running program.

<h2>Currently Completed</h2>
At the moment, our code doesn't have much functionality.  A very simple GUI was set up as a placeholder for the program.

<h3>Functionality</h3>
Details:
 <ul>
  <li>None except for the GUI opening</li>
 </ul>
 
<h3>GUI</h3>
Details:
  <ul>
    <li>A mock GUI of what the interface may look like</li>
  </ul>
